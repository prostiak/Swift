# Twittermenti

Using our ML trained model we can understand if top 100 tweets of entered brand are bad or good. Also we use twitter API in project.


To make the app work you need to create in project new Class Secrets and to fill its values by your API key and secret:

class Secrets {
    
    var key = ""
    
    var secret = ""
    
}
